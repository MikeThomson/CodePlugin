CodePlugin for Adium
=============

About
------

CodePlugin is a plugin for the popular Mac OSX chat client Adium. It's goal is
to simplify pasting code blocks between developers.  To use it, just prefix
your message with '%CODE ' and the rest of the message will be popped up in a
new window. This window is editable, making easy to fix things and copy the 
result back to the other person.

TODO
----
* Add syntax highlighting. This will probably only happen if I can find a good
Objective-C library for code highlighting.
